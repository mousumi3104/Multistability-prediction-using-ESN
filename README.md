# Multistability-prediction-using-ESN

In  this study, we investigate a data-driven ESN approach to infer different dynamics of a multistable system using echo state network (ESN). We start with a parameter-aware
reservoir and predict diverse dynamics for different parameter values. Interestingly, machine is able to reproduce the dynamics almost perfectly even at distant parameters which lie considerably far from the parameter values related to
the training dynamics. In continuation, we can predict whole bifurcation diagram significant accuracy as well. We extend this study for exploring various dynamics of multistable attractors at unknown parameter value. Continuing the simulation for multiple set of initial conditions, we can identify the
basins for different attractors.
